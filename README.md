# ShoppingList_wRedux
Shopping list app. 

This app will use the following: React.js, Redux, Saga, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.

I built this app to practice using Redux/React.

This app is a simple shopping list:
    - User can add an item to the list by clicking the green 'plus' in the upper right of the screen.
    - The item will be displayed below in the form of a list.
        * Click on the item to have it crossed out.
        * The total number of items not crossed out are displayed at the top left.

    - To remove an item from the list permanently click the red 'X' to the right of the list item.

    - User can edit any item by using the drop down menu and selecting edit.
        * An edit button will appear beside the list item
        * clicking edit will open a window with the current item
          info displayed. User can overwrite this info and save.

    - Usesr can select the store of which to display the items.

    - User can log out from the drop down menu.

Future improvements:

*) Add feature to keep user logged in.

*) Add feature to allow user to enter new item with the previous store set as default for convience.
