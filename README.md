# ShoppingList_wRedux
Shopping list app. 


This app will use the following: React.js, Redux, Saga, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.


I built this app to practice using Redux.

This app is a simple shopping list:
    - User can add an item to the list by clicking the green 'plus' in the upper right of the screen.
    - The item will be displayed below in the form of a list.
        * Click on the item to have it crossed out
        * The total number of items not crossed out are displayed at the top left.

        * To remove an item from the list permanently click the red 'X' to the right of the list item.

Future improvements

*) Add a user sign up and login.

*) Add tab to display a store and the items entered under that store name
